# Call for Participation: Paid Study on the Accessibility of Charts and Graphs
Greetings!

[Fizz Studio](https://www.fizz.studio) is now recruiting people with disabilities for a paid usability study on the accessibility of charts and graphs. 

We are seeking adults with blindness, low vision, other visual impairments, or motor impairment, who regularly use assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, switches, or non-mouse interaction devices with computers. 

Please share this recruitment information with your network and those who you think may be interested or who know someone else interested.

## Details

### What are the study’s goals?
* To evaluate the usability and accessibility of interactive charts and graphs.
* To improve the quality and efficiency of data work for people who use assistive technologies.

### What does the study involve?
* $150 for 2 hours of work ($75/hour)
* Interacting with specific charts and graphs designed to work with assistive technologies in desktop browsers
* Performing data-related tasks using these charts and graphs
* Providing feedback on the usability and design of this system

### When and where?
Virtually over Zoom in a single 2-hour session or two 1-hour sessions, depending on participant preference. Participants will be compensated once their session is complete or they reach the 2-hour mark for total work, whichever comes first.

Slots are available to schedule during May and early June, 2022. 

### Who can participate?
* Age 18+
* Live in the United States
* Ability to communicate in English (written or spoken)

* Lived experience with using an assistive technology with a desktop computer (see technology requirements)
* Willing to schedule time during weekdays between the hours of 8am and 6pm Eastern Time.
* Introductory familiarity with data (tables, spreadsheets, charts, or graphs) 
* Optional: We are especially interested in working with participants with more advanced experience with data representations (such as tables, charts, and graphs), or who have worked with data professionally. Lack of advanced experience is not exclusive; the study seeks people from a wide range of experience.

### Technology Requirements

* Must have stable broadband-level internet connection
* Must have a Mac or Windows desktop computer
* Must use Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
* Must have Zoom teleconferencing software
* Must regularly use at least 1 assistive technology among the following:

## Ethics information

### Privacy and Security

Sessions may be recorded but all participant information will be anonymized and session and participant data will be stored on a protected, secure network according to IRB requirements. Only members of the research and technology teams will have access to the session recordings and only for the purpose of this study.

### Autonomy

Participants may quit or leave participation at any time and are under no obligation or contract to finish this work. Participants are strongly encouraged to communicate all of their needs up front and during the working session.

### Risk and Harm

Participants will incur minimal risks in participation, since participation is virtual and uses digital technology. However, potential risks and labor may include:
* Encountering access barriers when performing requested tasks during the study.
* Engaging questions and topics related to working with a disability or impairment.
* Participating in sessions lasting as long as 1 hour at a time (though this is negotiable based on requested accommodations).
